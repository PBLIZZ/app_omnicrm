Assess the quality of coding and it's effect on the codebase since the last audit.

Do the following:

1. Deploy all 8 auditor subagents to audit the codebase.
2. Create a new folder with todays date @docs/audits/[date].
3. Provide them with the filepath to the last set of audited reports @docs/audits/[date] where date is the most recent date in the past.
4. Instruct them to use the report they read as the baseline and to assess the difference between what was reported and what they find.
5. Tell them to create a similarly formatted report that is updated and to save it to the folder @docs/audit/[date] where date is today's date.
6. Once all 8 reports are completed, create a README indexing the reports in the same folder and provide an executive summary.
7. Deploy the agile-sprint-orchestrator subagent.

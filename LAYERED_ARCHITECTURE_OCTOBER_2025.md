# Layered Architecture Refactoring - October 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the systematic refactoring of our application's layered architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns, consistent patterns, and proper type boundaries.

## Source of Truth: Database Schema

### Primary Schema Files

- **`src/server/db/schema.ts`** - Manually synced Drizzle schema (application source of truth)
- **`src/server/db/database.types.ts`** - Direct download from Supabase (database source of truth)

These two files must remain synchronized and serve as the canonical source for all database types.

### Schema Organization Philosophy

**Business Schemas (`src/server/db/business-schemas/`)** should exist ONLY for:

- API-specific request/response schemas
- Query parameter schemas
- Schemas that differ from database types
- Business logic validations that extend beyond database constraints

**Criteria for business-schemas**: A type should only exist here if it represents an API contract or business rule that differs from the raw database schema.

## Phase 1: Business Schemas Audit

### Objective

Verify each business-schema file contains ONLY unique types not already in `schema.ts`. Remove duplicates and unnecessary abstractions.

### Files to Audit

## Phase 2: Repository Layer Refactoring

### Objectives

Refactor each repository file to ensure:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Data access only, no business logic
2. **Consistent Error Handling** - Uniform error patterns across all repos
3. **Clear Type Boundaries** - Proper use of schema types vs business types
4. **Consistent Patterns** - Standardized method signatures and return types

### Repository Files

## Notes & Decisions

### Date: 2025-10-04

- Document created
- Refactoring approach defined
- Files catalogued and ready for audit
- **Completed contacts.repo.ts refactoring** - Established as gold standard pattern
- **Completed notes.repo.ts refactoring** - Removed all validation and business logic (Zod schemas, PII redaction). Repository now contains only pure data access operations following the contacts.repo.ts pattern.
- **Created notes.service.ts** - Established service layer for notes domain following contacts.service.ts pattern. Includes PII redaction business logic, error handling, and proper separation of concerns.

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Audit business-schemas files
2. Document findings and remove duplicates
3. Update business-schemas index exports
4. Begin Phase 2: Repository refactoring
5. Establish service layer patterns (Phase 3 - TBD)

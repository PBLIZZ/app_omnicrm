# Layered Architecture Refactoring - October 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the systematic refactoring of our application's layered architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns, consistent patterns, and proper type boundaries.

## Source of Truth: Database Schema

### Primary Schema Files

- **`src/server/db/schema.ts`** - Manually synced Drizzle schema (application source of truth)
- **`src/server/db/database.types.ts`** - Direct download from Supabase (database source of truth)

These two files must remain synchronized and serve as the canonical source for all database types.

### Schema Organization Philosophy

**Business Schemas (`src/server/db/business-schemas/`)** should exist ONLY for:

- API-specific request/response schemas
- Query parameter schemas
- Schemas that differ from database types
- Business logic validations that extend beyond database constraints

**Criteria for business-schemas**: A type should only exist here if it represents an API contract or business rule that differs from the raw database schema.

## Phase 1: Business Schemas Audit

### Objective
Verify each business-schema file contains ONLY unique types not already in `schema.ts`. Remove duplicates and unnecessary abstractions.

### Files to Audit

| File | Status | Date Checked | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/admin.ts` | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | No duplicates found. Contains only API-specific request/response schemas for admin operations. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/ai-insights.ts` | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | Removed duplicate base types. Now re-exports `AiInsight`, `CreateAiInsight`, `UpdateAiInsight` from schema.ts. Added `AiInsightWithUISchema` for UI-enhanced version with computed fields. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/calendar.ts` | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | Removed duplicate base types. Now re-exports `CalendarEvent`, `CreateCalendarEvent`, `UpdateCalendarEvent` from schema.ts. Added `CalendarEventWithUISchema` for UI-enhanced version with computed fields. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/chat.ts` | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | No duplicates found. Contains only API-specific request/response schemas for chat/RAG functionality. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/contacts.ts` | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | Removed duplicate base types. Now re-exports `Contact`, `CreateContact`, `UpdateContact` from schema.ts. Kept API-specific schemas like `ContactResponseSchema`, `ContactListResponseSchema`, `CreateContactBodySchema`, etc. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/interactions.ts`    | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | Removed duplicate base types. Now re-exports `Interaction`, `CreateInteraction`, `UpdateInteraction` from schema.ts. Added `InteractionWithUISchema` for UI-enhanced version with computed fields. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/jobs.ts`            | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | No duplicates found. Contains only API-specific request/response schemas for job processing and cron operations. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/notes.ts`           | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | Removed duplicate base types. Now re-exports `Note`, `CreateNote`, `UpdateNote` from schema.ts. Kept API-specific schemas like `CreateNoteBodySchema`, `UpdateNoteBodySchema`, `GetNotesQuerySchema`. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/onboarding.ts`      | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | No duplicates found. Contains only API-specific schemas for token management and onboarding form submission. No database table for onboarding. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/projects.ts`        | ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only | 2025-10-04 | Removed duplicate base types. Now re-exports `Project`, `CreateProject`, `UpdateProject` from schema.ts. Added `ProjectWithUISchema` for UI-enhanced version with computed fields. |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/storage.ts`         | ‚¨ú Not Started | -            |       |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/sync-progress.ts`   | ‚¨ú Not Started | -            |       |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/tasks.ts`           | ‚¨ú Not Started | -            |       |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/user-management.ts` | ‚¨ú Not Started | -            |       |
| `src/server/db/business-schemas/zones.ts`           | ‚¨ú Not Started | -            |       |

**Legend:**

- ‚¨ú Not Started
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed - Unique types only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Completed - Issues found (see notes)

## Phase 2: Repository Layer Refactoring

### Objective

Refactor each repository file to ensure:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Data access only, no business logic
2. **Consistent Error Handling** - Uniform error patterns across all repos
3. **Clear Type Boundaries** - Proper use of schema types vs business types
4. **Consistent Patterns** - Standardized method signatures and return types

### Repository Files

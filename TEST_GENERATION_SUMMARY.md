## Testing Framework

All tests use:
- **Vitest** - Modern, fast test runner
- **Vi Mocking** - Type-safe mocking utilities
- **@packages/testing** - Custom test factories and utilities
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety in tests

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

```typescript
it("should successfully enrich all clients", async () => {
  // Arrange
  const mockContacts = makeBatch(() => makeOmniClient(), 3);
  mockListContactsService.mockResolvedValue({ items: mockContacts });
  
  // Act
  const result = await ClientEnrichmentService.enrichAllClients(userId);
  
  // Assert
  expect(result.enrichedCount).toBe(3);
});
```

### 2. Comprehensive Mock Setup

All tests properly mock:
- Database operations
- External services
- Logging utilities
- Repository calls

### 3. Edge Case Coverage

Tests include:
- Empty data sets
- Null/undefined values
- Error scenarios
- Partial failures
- Rate limiting
- Database errors

### 4. Realistic Test Data

Using factory functions from `@packages/testing`:
- `makeOmniClient()` / `makeOmniClientWithNotes()`
- `makeBatch()` for bulk data
- `makeInteraction()`
- Faker.js for realistic values

## Running the Tests

### Run All New Tests

```bash
pnpm test src/server/services/client-enrichment.service.test.ts
pnpm test src/server/services/error-tracking.service.test.ts  
pnpm test src/server/services/job-status.service.test.ts
```

### Run All Service Tests

```bash
pnpm test src/server/services/
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
pnpm test:coverage src/server/services/
```

### Watch Mode (for development)

```bash
pnpm test:watch src/server/services/client-enrichment.service.test.ts
```

## Test Quality Metrics

### Code Coverage Goals

- **Line Coverage**: >90%
- **Branch Coverage**: >85%
- **Function Coverage**: 100% for public methods
- **Statement Coverage**: >90%

### Test Characteristics

- **Fast Execution**: All mocks, no real I/O
- **Isolated**: No dependencies between tests
- **Deterministic**: Consistent results every run
- **Readable**: Clear test names and structure
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update when code changes

## CI/CD Integration

These tests are automatically run:
- On every pull request
- Before merging to main
- In the CI/CD pipeline
- With coverage reporting

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Test Naming**: Descriptive names that explain the scenario
2. **One Assertion Focus**: Each test validates one specific behavior
3. **Mock Isolation**: Tests don't depend on external systems
4. **Error Testing**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript typing throughout
6. **Documentation**: Clear comments for complex scenarios
7. **Async Handling**: Proper async/await usage
8. **Test Data**: Realistic data using factories

## Future Test Additions

Consider adding tests for:
- Additional new services introduced in the branch
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user workflows
- Performance tests for bulk operations
- Load tests for concurrent operations

## Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

- When service method signatures change
- When adding new features
- When fixing bugs (add regression test)
- When refactoring code
- When dependencies change

### Test Review Checklist

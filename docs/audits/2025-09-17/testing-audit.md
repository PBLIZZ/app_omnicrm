## Detailed Test Quality Analysis

### 1. Unit Test Quality: SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED ✅

**Mock Strategy Excellence:**

```typescript
// Example: Sophisticated Database Mocking
vi.mock("@/server/db/client", () => {
  const db = {
    select: () => ({
      from: (_table: unknown) => ({
        where: (_cond: unknown) => ({
          orderBy: () => ({ limit: async () => [] }),
          limit: async () => shared.prefsStore.length ? [shared.prefsStore[0]!] : []
        })
      })
    }),
    insert: (_table: unknown) => ({
      values: async (row: Record<string, unknown>) => {
        // Smart routing based on data structure
        if ((row as { provider?: unknown }).provider) {
          shared.rawEvents.push(row);
        } else if ((row as { kind?: unknown }).kind) {
          shared.jobs.push(row);
        }
      }
    })
  };
  return { getDb: async () => db, db };
});

// Example: Comprehensive Fetch Mocking
global.fetch = vi.fn().mockImplementation((url: string) => {
  if (url.includes("/api/contacts-new")) {
    return Promise.resolve({
      ok: true, status: 200,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({ ok: true, data: { id: "new-contact" } })
    });
  }
  // Default response for all other URLs
  return Promise.resolve({
    ok: true, status: 200,
    json: () => Promise.resolve({ ok: true, data: {} })
  });
});
```

**Strengths:**

- Sophisticated mock strategies with smart routing
- Comprehensive environment variable management
- Excellent test isolation and cleanup
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Good error handling and edge case coverage

**Remaining Issues:**

- Some tests still have import resolution failures
- Minor mock strategy gaps for complex integrations
- Need for more comprehensive API response mocking

### 2. Component Testing: STRONG FOUNDATION ✅

**Test Infrastructure Excellence:**

- React Testing Library setup comprehensive and effective
- Component rendering tests stable and reliable
- Mock prop strategies working well

- Accessibility testing considerations included

**Example Quality Test:**

```typescript
// NotesHoverCard comprehensive testing
describe("NotesHoverCard", () => {
  describe("Notes Loading", () => {
    it("does not fetch notes if clientId is empty", async () => {
      render(<NotesHoverCard clientId="" clientName="Test" />);
      await waitFor(() => {
        expect(mockUseNotes).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ clientId: "", enabled: false });
      });
    });
  });

  describe("Accessibility", () => {
    it("provides proper ARIA labels", async () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(
        <NotesHoverCard clientId="123" clientName="John Doe" />
      );
      expect(getByRole("button")).toHaveAttribute("aria-describedby");
    });
  });
});
```

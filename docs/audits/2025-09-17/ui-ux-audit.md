  <Button
    className="h-11 w-11 p-0 md:h-8 md:w-8 touch-manipulation"
    style={{ minHeight: "44px", minWidth: "44px" }}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </Button>
);
```

#### Critical Priority: Mobile Search Restoration

**Mobile Search Implementation:**

```tsx
// Restore mobile search functionality
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  className="md:hidden h-11 w-11"
  onClick={handleSearch}
>
  <Search className="h-5 w-5" />
  <span className="sr-only">Search</span>
</Button>
```

## 10. Performance Impact on User Experience

### Current Implementation: GOOD (Maintained)

#### Loading Performance ‚úÖ GOOD (Stable)

**Component Loading Patterns:**

Performance characteristics remain similar to September 4 baseline:

- **Lazy Loading:** Route-based code splitting maintained - Working
- **Skeleton Components:** Proper loading state implementations - Functional
- **Optimistic UI:** Immediate feedback for user actions - Working

**React Query Integration:**

- **Caching Strategy:** Intelligent data caching - Maintained
- **Background Updates:** Automatic data synchronization - Working
- **Error Recovery:** Automatic retry mechanisms - Functional

#### Perceived Performance ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (Maintained)

**User Experience Optimizations:**

Same excellent patterns as September 4 continue to work:

- **Instant Feedback:** Button states change immediately - Working
- **Optimistic Updates:** UI updates before server confirmation - Functional
- **Progressive Loading:** Content appears incrementally - Maintained

### Issues Identified

#### Loading State Consistency (MODERATE - Unchanged)

**Same Issues as September 4:**

1. **Skeleton Implementation Variations**
   - Some components use custom loading indicators - **Unchanged**
   - Not all loading states use proper skeleton components - **Same**
   - Inconsistent loading patterns across similar components - **Unchanged**

2. **Error State Handling**
   - Some components have better error states than others - **Same**
   - Error recovery options vary by component - **Unchanged**
   - Missing error boundaries in certain component trees - **Same**

#### Job Processing Performance Impact (NEW CONSIDERATION)

**Backend Migration Impact:**

- **September 4:** Vercel cron-based job processing
- **Current:** Supabase pg_cron job processing
- **Performance Impact:** Backend change should improve reliability
- **User Visibility:** Still no UI for monitoring job performance

### Performance Recommendations

#### Medium Priority: Loading State Standardization

**Same recommendations as September 4 remain valid:**

```tsx
// Standardized loading component
export const ContactTableSkeleton = () => (
  <div className="space-y-3">
    {[...Array(10)].map((_, i) => (
      <div key={i} className="flex items-center space-x-4 p-4">
        <Skeleton className="h-8 w-8 rounded-full" />
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-48" />
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-24 ml-auto" />
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

#### High Priority: Job Performance Monitoring

**New Recommendation for Job Migration:**

```tsx
// Job performance monitoring component
export function JobPerformanceMonitor() {
  const { data: jobMetrics } = useJobMetrics();

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Background Job Performance</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
          <Metric label="Jobs Completed" value={jobMetrics?.completed} />
          <Metric label="Average Duration" value={jobMetrics?.avgDuration} />
          <Metric label="Success Rate" value={jobMetrics?.successRate} />
          <Metric label="Queue Depth" value={jobMetrics?.queueDepth} />
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

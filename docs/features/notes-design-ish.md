OmniCRM Notes System Design Specification

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: October 2025
Owner: Product Design Team, Omnipotency AI
Context: Wellness Practitioner Use Case

1. Product Overview

The Notes System is the central nervous system of OmniCRM ‚Äî a living memory that captures, organizes, and connects practitioner thoughts, voice memos, and observations to client timelines. For wellness professionals, notes are not just records; they‚Äôre reflections of client progress, insight, and care.

Practitioners must be able to capture notes anywhere, in any format (voice or text), link them instantly to the right client, and review them later with full fidelity ‚Äî including rich text formatting, contextual AI insights, and voice transcriptions.

2. Core Product Vision

Capture should be effortless.
Three clicks maximum: search contact ‚Üí record or type ‚Üí save.

Notes are the nucleus of the contact view.
They sit front and center in the contact card, not hidden behind tabs.

Voice is a natural input.
Speech-to-text transcription via Whisper, with editing before save.

Formatting matters.
Notes should preserve structure, color, and emphasis from the practitioner‚Äôs original style.

Context builds trust.
The last note preview is visible everywhere the contact appears.

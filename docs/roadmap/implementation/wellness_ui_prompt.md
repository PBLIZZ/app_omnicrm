# Wellness Solopreneur Platform - UI/UX Design Brief

## Core Vision

Design a beautiful, intuitive interface for an AI-powered platform that helps wellness solopreneurs manage their practice while the AI handles admin tasks in the background.

## Target User

Wellness solopreneurs (massage therapists, coaches, yoga instructors) who want to focus on client care while AI manages scheduling, communications, and business operations.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Reduce cognitive load** - Information revealed in progressive layers
2. **AI-human collaboration** - Clear approval workflows for AI-generated actions
3. **Client-centric design** - Contact cards as the central interface element
4. **Effortless efficiency** - One-click actions and smart suggestions

## Core Features (MVP Priority)

### 1. Contact Management Hub (Primary Interface)

**Design Requirements:**

- **Card-based layout** with contact photos as visual anchors
- **Progressive disclosure** - essential info visible, details on hover/click
- **Smart action buttons** - contextual to client lifecycle stage
- **Hover cards** for notes with quick actions (add entry, open full card)
- **Visual status indicators** - client lifecycle stage, last interaction
- **AI insights integration** - recent social media activity, important updates

### 2. AI Approval Center

**Design Requirements:**

- **Morning briefing format** - "Good morning [Name], here's what I've prepared..."
- **Batch approval interface** - continuous scroll with approve/reject/edit badges
- **Context cards** - show reasoning and source data for each AI suggestion
- **Preview mode** - see exactly what will be sent before approval
- **Smart defaults** - pre-select likely approvals based on user patterns

### 3. Intelligent Task Management

**Design Requirements:**

- **Three-tier hierarchy** - Projects > Tasks > Subtasks
- **AI vs Human ownership** clearly distinguished with visual cues
- **Due date and priority sorting** with color coding
- **Quick assign** contacts or groups to tasks
- **Progress visualization** for ongoing projects

### 4. Dashboard Overview

**Design Requirements:**

- **Minimal, scannable metrics** - key numbers at a glance
- **Trend visualizations** - client growth, revenue, engagement
- **Quick action tiles** - most common daily tasks
- **AI suggestion highlights** - "3 clients ready for upsell"

## Design System Requirements

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with max 3 font weights
- **Color System**: Calming wellness palette with strong accent for CTAs
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for reduced cognitive load
- **Cards**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, clear content boundaries

### 2025 Design Trends Integration

- **Glassmorphism** for overlay elements and modals
- **Micro-interactions** for feedback on hover, click, and state changes
- **Dark mode support** for evening/weekend work sessions
- **Voice input options** for note-taking and commands
- **Smart suggestions** appearing contextually as user types
- **Gesture-friendly** mobile interactions

### Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**
- **Keyboard navigation** for all interactions
- **Screen reader optimization**
- **High contrast mode** available

## Technical Implementation Instructions

### Component Structure

Create a **React component library** with:

1. **ContactCard** component with hover states and progressive disclosure
2. **ApprovalQueue** component with batch actions
3. **TaskCard** component with owner/assignee indicators
4. **MetricTile** component for dashboard
5. **ActionButton** component with contextual styling

### State Management

- **Optimistic updates** for immediate feedback
- **Background sync** with loading states
- **Error boundaries** with graceful fallbacks
- **Offline capability** for core functions

### Performance Optimization

- **Lazy loading** for contact images and detailed views
- **Virtualized lists** for large contact databases
- **Debounced search** with instant local filtering
- **Progressive loading** of AI insights

## Success Criteria

1. **User can complete daily client review in under 5 minutes**
2. **AI approval process takes under 30 seconds for typical morning batch**
3. **Zero training required** - intuitive navigation and clear visual cues
4. **Mobile-responsive** - works seamlessly on tablet/phone
5. **Fast loading** - under 2 seconds for main contact view

## Output Requirements

Provide:

1. **Detailed wireframes** for each core component
2. **Interactive prototypes** showing key user flows
3. **Component specifications** with props and states
4. **Design system documentation** with colors, typography, spacing
5. **Implementation roadmap** with development priorities

## Key Design Principles

- **AI as invisible assistant** - powerful but unobtrusive
- **Information when needed** - progressive disclosure prevents overwhelm
- **Beautiful simplicity** - wellness aesthetic meets professional efficiency
- **Trust through transparency** - always show AI reasoning and allow override

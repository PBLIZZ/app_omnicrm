# API Types File Eliminated

This file contained API abstraction types (OkEnvelope, ErrorEnvelope, ApiResponse) that have been eliminated in favor of direct patterns.

## Replacements

Instead of importing these types, use direct patterns:

```typescript
// ❌ Old pattern
import { ApiResponse, OkEnvelope, ErrorEnvelope } from "./types";

// ✅ Direct pattern
type ApiResponse<T> = { ok: true; data: T } | { ok: false; error: string; details?: unknown };
```

## File eliminated:
- Removed dependency on abstraction types
- All usage replaced with direct envelope patterns
- Hooks updated to use inline retry logic
- Error handling moved to direct toast patterns
